# Student-ExamDataAdministration

•	Created a C++ program for instructors and students to retrieve and update exam and student related information.
•	Used OOP concepts and struct vectors to store information about upcoming exams and student data.
• Instructors can create new exams, see who signed up for exams, and see summary of results of exams already taken. 
• Students can sign up or opt out of exams and check their scores for past exams taken.
